## Dictionary format

This is the file containing all the words and phrases that players will have to type in the game when they play with your Workshop dictionary enabled.

This needs to be a simple text file (*.txt) with each word and phrase written on a separate line:

```
SOLID
DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself
YAGNI
You Ain't Gonna Need It
C# is cool!
...
```

In this repository, this is done in the file `/dictionary/coding-dictionary.txt`.

You can create this file with your favourite text editor before saving it and selecting it here.
The only thing to keep in mind is that only the following characters are supported in-game:

`aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ0)1!2\"3#4$5%6^7&8*9(-_=+ /?,<.>;:'@`

Any other characters will be replaced in-game with ones that it can display.
